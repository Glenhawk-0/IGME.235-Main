/*
im getting very upset, ive had to skim through all the web app chapters because i was busy with 
the project, now alongside these excercises and other homework in this class, i have 
over 12 assignments to do and im not understanding what im doing for really any of these excecises so far... 
but it looks like were transitioning straight into the next project now after these... 
im not really gonna actually learn any of this am i?
of course. "go back and read the material" but as was said earlier , in this class alone 
i now have over 12 assignments. unfourtunatly i have a few other classes that also demand my attention
that i am currently skimping out on FOR THIS CLASS.. i dont blame you professor travis. their is 
clearly not enough time in class to go though all of these in the intended way, that being in class
excercises. but its just frusterating going through all not knowing what the hell im doing for any of them.

i guess in conclusion.. im aware i did this in an unintended way. but i cant afford to sit here 
and figure it out, i risk my grades for other classes droping. i have to move on as fast as i can.
i apologize
