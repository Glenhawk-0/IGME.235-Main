    <p> i think my plan is to essentially make breakout. i dont believe im at a high enough programing level to go really much above pong and such. so ill go with this and perhaps try to add powerups, but that isnt a guarentee.</p>
    <p>ill also being using the circle Blast homework as a base. perhaps i can repurpose some of the code for shooting as powrerups</p>
