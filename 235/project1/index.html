        <div class="infoA1 , infosA">Darkest Dungeon is a roguelike role-playing video game developed and published 
        by Red Hook Studios. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and OS X in January 2016,
         which followed a year-long early access development period.</div>  
      
        <div class="infoA2 , infosA"> Later that year,
        it was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Linux,
         with a port for iOS being released in 2017, and ports for Nintendo Switch and Xbox One being 
         released by 2018. Darkest Dungeon has the player manage a roster of heroes</div>  
      
        <div class="infoA3 , infosA"> to explore dungeons below a gothic mansion the player has inherited. 
            Played out in a mix of real-time movement and turn-based combat, a core feature of Darkest Dungeon
             is the stress level of each hero that increases with further exploration and combat;</div>


      <div class="infoB1 , infosB">Director Chris Bourassa and lead designer Tyler Sigman had become friends
         while working at Backbone Entertainment, and had talked about the idea of building a game together,
          but their commitments to other studios left them unable to do so. </div>  
      <div class="infoB2 , infosB">During 2012 and early 2013,
        they had brainstormed a number of ideas for potential games to develop.</div>
