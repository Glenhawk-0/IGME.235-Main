    <p>Hello this is me after ive.. Uh ... "completed" this assinment. and i guess the most challenging part about this.. was looking back at this assignment after all the effort i put into it and thinking... this is complete garbage. clearly ive learned nothing and havent been paying as much attention as i should have. so many other students in this class are doing so much better, whats my excuse? ugh.. i really dont belong here do i?</p>
    <P>Getting things to line up without words bleeding over ontop of other elements has proven to be impossible for me. so essentially the basic stuff. sorry for wasting your time professor. </p>
